## Steam features

Steam offers _a lot_ of features. Learn about them!

---

### What to do in pre-release

- Launch a coming soon store page when you have something to show
- Wishlists are important for measuring possible success
- Followers are important for direct communication
- Join Steam Next Fest with a demo ~3 months before launch
- Wishlist count often tops out shortly after launch, between 2x and 4x of pre-launch Steam wishlists
- Launching a game 5-7 days before a seasonal sale may be worth it (16 new release spots)

---

### Store page tips

- Your best marketing tool (that's where buyers are!)
- Always keep the store page up to date
- Be specific in the description (usually)
- Be creative!
- Call to action in the description
- Use short and wide eye-catching gifs
- Keep the above the fold text easy to read
- Use the below the fold text for extra details about your game
- Capsules (banners) should be catchy and readable

note:

- Silly games should have a silly description, dark games a darker one, etc.
- "Above the fold" text means anything above "Read more" which gets shown when you go over the certain limit in the full description.
- Call to action means a simple "feature" list with sentences like "Explore the vast world", "Roam through the Rocky Mountains" etc.
- Example store page I wrote is [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1209471/American_Truck_Simulator__Colorado/)

---

### Store page tips

- Have a good trailer! See [Derek Lieu's tips](https://www.derek-lieu.com/start-here)
- Show gameplay in your trailer, quickly (think: TikTok!)
- Tag your game with [Tag Wizard](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/tags#2)
- Use Steam bundles if you have OST or other DLCs
- Set temporary capsules (banners) for special events
- Translate and localize your store pages
- DLCs get a special page where you can categorize them

note:

Localizing means e.g. for Bulanci, I bet more on nostalgia from Czech players at the start of the [description](https://web.archive.org/web/20221113101501/https://store.steampowered.com/app/1732920/Bulanci/?l=czech). The [English version](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328085522/https://store.steampowered.com/app/1732920/Bulanci/) of the text didn't have it.

---

### Developer page

- Central hub to showcase all of your games
- For devs, publishers and game franchises
- Visibility throughout the store + emails when following
- Possibility to create dev/pub-wide sales
- Example: [PlayWay](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/playway)

---

### Discounting

- Discount as often as possible (10-12x per year) to maximize revenue
- Launch discount (10%) is a good incentive
	- You could instead have a special launch bundle!
- Start your first sale after ~3 months
- Gradually increase discount %
- Beware: There are discount cooldowns! (except for seasonal sales)
- Discounting repeatedly adds wishlists, but also purchases and wishlist deletes

note:

- Sorry, Factorio and Beat Saber!
- Launch discount within 7 days of a Steam-wide seasonal sale events (like the Summer Sale) - Valve can extend the launch discount to last through the sale event

---

### Discounting

- Always join the main seasonal sales
- Join other Steam events (themed sales) and third-party events (LudoNarraCon etc.)
- Join the Czech & Slovak Games Week ;)
- Wishlist numbers get significantly bumped when featured
- Ask yourselves: Are you or your publisher in charge of discounting? Are your discounts set up well? Are you maximizing revenue?

---

### Sale pages

- Self-made sale pages
- Dev/pub wide or for events
- Game streams are catchy!

note:

- The sale page editor needs to be enabled by Valve

---

### Steam bundles

- Multiple games, or mix & match with DLCs
- Also: Cooperative bundles with other devs
- Can be created and discounted any time (sale cooldown hack!)
- Bundle cheaper than base game = game shows up as discounted

---

### Other store/community features

- Trading cards with profile badges and chat emoticons
- [Points Shop](https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop) items
- [Steam Playtests](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/testing)

---

## In-game features

- Achievements - people expect them
- Steam Cloud saves - ever played a game without it and lost saves?
- Leaderboards
- Workshop - cross-platform alternative: https://mod.io/
- Inventory + market
- Steam Deck support is important!

---

## Use Steam for your advantage

---

## Internal tools

RTFM!  
https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/

---

### Steam announcements

- Tell your players about what's happening
- Patch notes, dev diaries, irl and online events, discounts
- Free visibility throughout store, library and community
- Events can start and end at a specific time

---

### Steam discussions

- Talk with people interested in your game
- Discord is cool but this has a lower barrier of entry
	- Expect some bad comments too!
- Hire a community manager/social media person

---

### Reviews

- Goal: Try to get over 500 very positive reviews
- But at least 10 reviews for tiny indie games
- Higher review % = higher chance of buying
- Don't be scared to reply to constructive feedback
- Reply also to positive reviews!

note:

- Steam starts showing review rating after the first 10 reviews
- Games popular in China often have issues with negative reviews, as Steam Community is blocked there, so reviews are their only way of communication

---

### Early Access: Yes or no?

- Worth trying for games which aren't linear singleplayer
- Remember: You get only one launch

note:
Like any business relationship, it's important to keep in touch so they don't forget about you. No need to do it every day/week, but communicating every few months is key.
